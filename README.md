```

## Endpoint Configuration

This section explains the usage, intent and behavior of each property on the `request` and `response` objects.

Here is a fully-populated, unrealistic endpoint:
```yaml
-  request:
      url: ^/your/awesome/endpoint$
      method: POST
      query:
         exclamation: post requests can have query strings!
      headers:
         content-type: application/xml
      post: >
         <!xml blah="blah blah blah">
         <envelope>
            <unaryTag/>
         </envelope>
      file: tryMyFirst.xml
   response:
      status: 200
      latency: 5000
      headers:
         content-type: application/xml
         server: stubbedServer/4.2
      body: >
         <!xml blah="blah blah blah">
         <responseXML>
            <content></content>
         </responseXML>
      file: responseData.xml
```

### request

This object is used to match an incoming request to stubby against the available endpoints that have been configured.

#### url (required)

* is a full-fledged __regular expression__
* This is the only required property of an endpoint.
* signify the url after the base host and port (i.e. after `localhost:8882`).
* must begin with ` / `.
* any query paramters are stripped (so don't include them, that's what `query` is for).
    * `/url?some=value&another=value` becomes `/url`
* no checking is done for URI-encoding compliance.
    * If it's invalid, it won't ever trigger a match.

This is the simplest you can get:
```yaml
-  request:
      url: /
```

A demonstration using regular expressions:
```yaml
-  request:
      url: ^/has/to/begin/with/this/

-  request:
      url: /has/to/end/with/this/$

-  request:
      url: ^/must/be/this/exactly/with/optional/trailing/slash/?$
```

#### method

* defaults to `GET`.
* case-insensitive.
* can be any of the following:
    * HEAD
    * GET
    * POST
    * PUT
    * POST
    * DELETE
    * etc.

```yaml
-  request:
      url: /anything
      method: GET
```

* it can also be an array of values.

```yaml
-  request:
      url: /anything
      method: [GET, HEAD]

-  request:
      url: ^/yonder
      method:
         -  GET
         -  HEAD
         -  POST
```

#### query

* if ommitted, stubby ignores query parameters for the given url.
* a yaml hashmap of variable/value pairs.
* allows the query parameters to appear in any order in a uri

* The following will match either of these:
    * `/with/parameters?search=search+terms&filter=month`
    * `/with/parameters?filter=month&search=search+terms`

```yaml
-  request:
      url: ^/with/parameters$
      query:
         search: search terms
         filter: month
```

#### post

* if ommitted, any post data is ignored.
* the body contents of the server request, such as form data.

```yaml
-  request:
      url: ^/post/form/data$
      post: name=John&email=john@example.com
```

#### file

* if supplied, replaces `post` with the contents of the locally given file.
    * paths are relative from where stubby was executed.
* if the file is not found when the request is made, falls back to `post` for matching.
* allows you to split up stubby data across multiple files

```yaml
-  request:
      url: ^/match/against/file$
      file: postedData.json
      post: '{"fallback":"data"}'
```

postedData.json
```json
{"fileContents":"match against this if the file is here"}
```

* if `postedData.json` doesn't exist on the filesystem when `/match/against/file` is requested, stubby will match post contents against `{"fallback":"data"}` (from `post`) instead.

#### headers

* if ommitted, stubby ignores headers for the given url.
* case-insensitive matching of header names.
* a hashmap of header/value pairs similar to `query`.

The following endpoint only accepts requests with `application/json` post values:

```yaml
-  request:
      url: /post/json
      method: post
      headers:
         content-type: application/json
```

### response

Assuming a match has been made against the given `request` object, data from `response` is used to build the stubbed response back to the client.

#### status

* the HTTP status code of the response.
* integer or integer-like string.
* defaults to `200`.

```yaml
-  request:
      url: ^/im/a/teapot$
      method: POST
   response:
      status: 420
```

#### body

* contents of the response body
* defaults to an empty content body

```yaml
-  request:
      url: ^/give/me/a/smile$
   response:
      body: ':)'
```

#### file

* similar to `request.file`, but the contents of the file are used as the `body`.

```yaml
-  request:
      url: /
   response:
      file: extremelyLongJsonFile.json
```

#### headers

* similar to `request.headers` except that these are sent back to the client.

```yaml
-  request:
      url: ^/give/me/some/json$
   response:
      headers:
         content-type: application/json
      body: >
         [{
            "name":"John",
            "email":"john@example.com"
         },{
            "name":"Jane",
            "email":"jane@example.com"
         }]
```

#### latency

* time to wait, in milliseconds, before sending back the response
* good for testing timeouts, or slow connections

```yaml
-  request:
      url: ^/hello/to/jupiter$
   response:
      latency: 800000
      body: Hello, World!
```

## The Admin Portal

The admin portal is a RESTful(ish) endpoint running on `localhost:8889`. Or wherever you described through stubby's options.

### Supplying Endpoints to Stubby

Submit `POST` requests to `localhost:8889` or load a data-file (-d) with the following structure for each endpoint:

* `request`: describes the client's call to the server
   * `method`: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/etc.
   * `url`: the URI regex string. GET parameters should also be included inline here
   * `query`: a key/value map of query string parameters included with the request
   * `headers`: a key/value map of headers the server should respond to
   * `post`: a string matching the textual body of the response.
   * `file`: if specified, returns the contents of the given file as the request post. If the file cannot be found at request time, **post** is used instead
* `response`: describes the server's response to the client
   * `headers`: a key/value map of headers the server should use in it's response
   * `latency`: the time in milliseconds the server should wait before responding. Useful for testing timeouts and latency
   * `file`: if specified, returns the contents of the given file as the response body. If the file cannot be found at request time, **body** is used instead
   * `body`: the textual body of the server's response to the client
   * `status`: the numerical HTTP status code (200 for OK, 404 for NOT FOUND, etc.)

#### YAML (file only)
```yaml
-  request:
      url: ^/path/to/something$
      method: POST
      headers:
         authorization: "Basic usernamez:passwordinBase64"
      post: this is some post data in textual format
   response:
      headers:
         Content-Type: application/json
      latency: 1000
      status: 200
      body: You're request was successfully processed!

-  request:
      url: ^/path/to/anotherThing
      query:
         a: anything
         b: more
      method: GET
      headers:
         Content-Type: application/json
      post:
   response:
      headers:
         Content-Type: application/json
         Access-Control-Allow-Origin: "*"
      status: 204
      file: path/to/page.html

-  request:
      url: ^/path/to/thing$
      method: POST
      headers:
         Content-Type: application/json
      post: this is some post data in textual format
   response:
      headers:
         Content-Type: application/json
      status: 304
```

#### JSON (file or POST/PUT)
```json
[
  {
    "request": {
      "url": "^/path/to/something$", 
      "post": "this is some post data in textual format", 
      "headers": {
         "authorization": "Basic usernamez:passwordinBase64"
      },
      "method": "POST"
    }, 
    "response": {
      "status": 200, 
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      "latency": 1000,
      "body": "You're request was successfully processed!"
    }
  }, 
  {
    "request": {
      "url": "^/path/to/anotherThing", 
      "query": {
         "a": "anything",
         "b": "more"
      },
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      "post": null, 
      "method": "GET"
    }, 
    "response": {
      "status": 204, 
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"
      }, 
      "file": "path/to/page.html"
    }
  }, 
  {
    "request": {
      "url": "^/path/to/thing$",
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      "post": "this is some post data in textual format", 
      "method": "POST"
    }, 
    "response": {
      "status": 304, 
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      } 
    }
  }
]
```

If you want to load more than one endpoint via file, use either a JSON array or YAML list (-) syntax. On success, the response will contain `Location` in the header with the newly created resources' location

### Getting the Current List of Stubbed Endpoints

Performing a `GET` request on `localhost:8889` will return a JSON array of all currently saved responses. It will reply with `204 : No Content` if there are none saved.

Performing a `GET` request on `localhost:8889/<id>` will return the JSON object representing the response with the supplied id.

#### The Status Page

You can also view the currently configured endpoints by going to `localhost:8889/status`

### Changing Existing Endpoints

Perform `PUT` requests in the same format as using `POST`, only this time supply the id in the path. For instance, to update the response with id 4 you would `PUT` to `localhost:8889/4`.

### Deleting Endpoints

Send a `DELETE` request to `localhost:8889/<id>`

## The Stubs Portal

Requests sent to any url at `localhost:8882` (or wherever you told stubby to run) will search through the available endpoints and, if a match is found, respond with that endpoint's `response` data

### How Endpoints Are Matched

For a given endpoint, stubby only cares about matching the properties of the request that have been defined in the YAML. The exception to this rule is `method`; if it is omitted it is defaulted to `GET`.

For instance, the following will match any `POST` request to the root url:

```yaml
-  request:
      url: /
      method: POST
   response: {}
```

The request could have any headers and any post body it wants. It will match the above.

Pseudocode:

```
for each <endpoint> of stored endpoints {

   for each <property> of <endpoint> {
      if <endpoint>.<property> != <incoming request>.<property>
         next endpoint
   }

   return <endpoint>
}
```

## Programmatic API

### Referencing Stubby in Your Project

Add `stubby` as a reference within your project:

```
    PM> Install-Package stubby
```

### The Arugments Class

The `Arguments` class is a container for options used by the `Stubby` class during construction that correlate to the command-line options.

#### Public Properties

* `Admin` - Port for admin portal. Defaults to `8889`.
* `Stubs` - Port for stubs portal. Defaults to `8882`.
* `Tls` - Port for stubs https portal. Defaults to `7443`.
* `Location` - Hostname at which to bind stubby. Defaults to `localhost`.
* `Data` - Data file location to pre-load endpoints. YAML format.
* `Mute` - Prevent stubby from logging to the console. Defaults to `true`.
* `Watch` - Monitor supplied data file for changes and reload endpoints if necessary. Defaults to `false`.
* `VerboseEndpoints` - Include additional information about endpoints in the console. Defaults to `false`.

Here is the constructor and default values of each (public) property.

```cs
public Arguments() {
   Admin = 8889;
   Stubs = 8882;
   Tls = 7443;
   Location = "localhost";
   Data = null;
   Mute = true;
   Watch = false;
   VerboseEndpoints = false;
}
```

#### The Stubby Class

There is a single constructor that takes an instance of `Arguments` as it's parameter.

```cs
// Constructor
public Stubby(IArguments arguments);

//Start stubby's services
public void Start();

// Stop stubby's services
public void Stop();

// Get a listing of all of stubby's configured endpoints
public IList<Endpoint> GetAll();

// Get an endpoint back by id
public Endpoint Get(uint id);

// Find an endpoint by it's matching Request
public Endpoint Find(Request request);

// Swap out the configuration of one of the endpoints.
// True if successful.
public bool Replace(uint id, Endpoint endpoint);

// Remove an endpoint by id
// True if the operation succeeded
public bool Delete(uint id);

// Remove all configured endpoints from stubby
public void DeleteAll();

// Add a new endpoint configuration
// out: the generated id
// True if successful
public bool Add(Endpoint endpoint, out uint id);

// Add many new endpoint configurations
// out: the generated ids
// True if successful
public bool Add(IEnumerable<Endpoint> endpoints, out IList<uint> ids);
```

#### An Example (Pardon my NUnit)

```cs
[TestFixture]
public class MyIntegrationTest {
   private readonly Stubby _stubby = new Stubby(new Arguments {
      Admin = 9999,
      Stubs = 9992,
      Mute = true,
      Data = "../../YAML/endpoints.yaml"
   });

   [TestFixtureSetUp]
   public void Before() {
      _stubby.Start();
   }

   [TestFixtureTearDown]
   public void After() {
      _stubby.Stop();
   }

   [Test]...
}
```
